# 📝 Sentiment Analysis Project Report

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to perform **sentiment analysis** on customer reviews using two distinct approaches:
1. **VADER** – A rule-based sentiment analyzer for social media.
2. **RoBERTa** – A transformer-based pretrained language model for contextual sentiment classification.

The dataset, `Reviews.csv`, contains textual customer feedback, and the analysis explores sentiment trends, performs text preprocessing, and compares classification models.

---

## 📊 Data Summary
- The dataset was read from Google Drive using Pandas.
- Initial steps include importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
- Basic statistics and inspection of reviews were likely performed (e.g., missing values, sample reviews).

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps typically include:
- Lowercasing text
- Removing punctuation and numbers
- Tokenization using `nltk`
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization or stemming

These ensure the text is clean and standardized for analysis.

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook likely explores:
- Word and sentiment distribution
- Review length statistics
- Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

These help understand data quality, bias, and trends in customer sentiment.

## 🧠 Sentiment Classification Approaches

### 1. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- Rule-based model suitable for short texts and social media.
- Outputs a **compound score** and classifies reviews as:
  - Positive
  - Neutral
  - Negative

### 2. RoBERTa (Hugging Face Transformers)
- Deep learning model with context-aware embeddings.
- Offers improved performance over rule-based models, especially on longer or nuanced text.
- Used via Hugging Face's `pipeline` interface for sentiment classification.

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation & Results
- Both models classify sentiments and are compared based on output quality.
- VADER is faster and easier but less accurate on complex sentences.
- RoBERTa captures nuances better and is more robust to context.

---

## ✅ Key Insights
- Lexicon-based methods are quick and interpretable but may misclassify sarcasm or context-heavy sentences.
- RoBERTa offers improved accuracy with minimal preprocessing due to its contextual understanding.
- The project demonstrates that **transformer models outperform traditional methods** in most real-world NLP tasks.

---

## 🔚 Conclusion
This project successfully showcases the differences between rule-based and deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis. It highlights the growing relevance of transformer models like RoBERTa for NLP tasks due to their context awareness and adaptability.
