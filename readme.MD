# Sentiment Classification Using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression 
```This notebook demonstrates a sentiment classification task using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression with two feature extraction methods: Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.```

 ## Prerequisites To run this code, you’ll need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. The following Python libraries are also required:
 - `pandas` 
- `scikit-learn` 
- `nltk`

*NLTK Data Setup*
```To run the text preprocessing functions (e.g., lemmatization), you’ll need NLTK's wordnet and punkt data. Install them with:
python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')```
